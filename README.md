It's raining confetti! SAConfettiView is the easiest way to add fun, multi-colored confetti to your application and make users feel rewarded. Written in Swift, SAConfettiView is a subclass of UIView and is highly customizable. From various types and colors of confetti to different levels of intensity, you can make the confetti as fancy as you want.

## Installation

SAConfettiView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```swift
pod 'SAConfettiView', :git => 'https://github.com/gokhanakkurt/SAConfettiView.git', :branch => 'swift3'
```

And then run:

`$ pod install`

#### Manual Installation
To manually install SAConfettiView, simply add `SAConfettiView.swift` to your project.

## Usage

Creating a SAConfettiView is the same as creating a UIView:

```swift
let confettiView = SAConfettiView(frame: self.view.bounds)
```

Don't forget to add the subview!

```swift
self.view.addSubview(confettiView)
```

### Types

Pick one of the preconfigured types of confetti with the `.type` property, or create your own by providing a custom image. This property defaults to the `.confetti` type.

##### `.confetti`

```swift
confettiView.type = .confetti
```

##### `.triangle`

```

##### `.star`

```swift

```

##### `.diamond`

```swift

```

##### `.image`

```swift
confettiView.type = .image(UIImage(named: "smiley"))
```

### Colors

Set the colors of the confetti with the `.colors` property. This property has a default value of multiple colors.

``` swift
confettiView.colors = [UIColor.red, UIColor.green, UIColor.blue]
```

### Intensity

The intensity refers to how many particles are generated and how quickly they fall. Set the intensity of the confetti with the `.intensity` property by passing in a value between 0 and 1. The default intensity is 0.5.

``` swift
confettiView.intensity = 0.75
```

### Starting

To start the confetti, use

``` swift
confettiView.startConfetti()
```

### Stopping

To stop the confetti, use

``` swift
confettiView.stopConfetti()
```

### Status

To check if the confetti is active and currently being displayed, use

``` swift
confettiView.isActive()
```

Returns `true` if it is being displayed, and `false` if it is not.
